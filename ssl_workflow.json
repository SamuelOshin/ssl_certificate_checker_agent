  "long_description": "Hey! I'm SSL Guardian, your AI-powered SSL certificate monitoring agent. I help teams ensure their websites and APIs have valid, secure SSL/TLS certificates.\n\nJust share a domain name with me and I'll:\n- Check SSL certificate validity and expiration dates\n- Analyze certificate issuer and security details\n- Flag certificates expiring within 30 days\n- Provide detailed security information (key size, algorithms, SANs)\n- Support checking multiple domains simultaneously\n\nI can monitor single domains or batch check multiple sites. I keep things clear with emoji indicators: ✅ (valid), ⚠️ (expiring soon), ❌ (expired).\n\nWhen we chat, if you say hi or ask what I do, I'll explain and ask which domain(s) you'd like me to check. Just mention domain names like 'github.com' or 'check google.com, stackoverflow.com' and I'll get to work!\n\nPerfect for:\n- Pre-deployment security checks\n- Regular certificate monitoring\n- Troubleshooting SSL issues\n- Compliance verification",
